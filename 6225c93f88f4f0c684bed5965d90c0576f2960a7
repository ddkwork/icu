      "message": "I am not a Persian speaker, and I have no confidence if I did that it will produce a correct result. The previous version was proof-read by Persian localization folks and we are sure they have no worst issue than what we ship in m87. If I change line by line, I could introduce error and could cause even more problem. I think that should be done in ICU, and get Persian speaker to review them. We can do that after I stop the bleeding in m89 first (and m88 may cp that).",
