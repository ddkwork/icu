      "message": "Currently, Chrome with ICU 59 defines UChar to be |uint16_t| on Android for external callers and to be |char16_t| inside ICU. \n\nSee http://crbug.com/693640 and https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id\u003d6062\n(making it char16_t everywhere is  more complicated: see http://crbug.com/732026 )\n\nNow, I\u0027m trying to understand the implication of doing this (if any).\n\nOk. This and other system_coll* files are built with \u0027U_I18N_IMPLEMENTATION\u0027 so that this should be fine. (well, it\u0027s empirically shown that it\u0027s ok by your building and testing :-) ).",
