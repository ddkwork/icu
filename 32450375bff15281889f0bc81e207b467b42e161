We found a solution which addresses the issue more elegantly and also solves the the discrepancy that you observed.\n\nSo, instead of creating the required sections manually we now generate the BTI flag using a compiler flag. We add the flag to the data file only intentionally. This way we ensure if ICU ever introduces assembly files which include functions we still get a warning. \n\nWhat do you think?\n\nGreeting and Best Regards,\nAndr√©\n",
