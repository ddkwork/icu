      "message": "Sorry if this is coming out of nowhere but I just kinda stumbled into this. I just wanted to be easily able to link the ICU data with my MSVC built executable and,as the commit message notes, I kinda stumbled on to a simplification for all platforms. Truth in advertising using C added about 1400 bytes (which was \u003e 1MB already) to the ucidt\u003cx\u003e_data.o though with a bit of effort I might be able to get rid of some of the teeny extra bit of fat. Doesn\u0027t seem worth much effort.\n\nI could also make it so it only uses the straight to C approach with a Windows build but that seems a little silly, adding complexity rather than removing it. I tested the cange with Windows (MSVC and clang), Linux (x86 Linux, zLinux, and Power Linux), and macOs. I don\u0027t have an ARM build in my menagerie yet but not sure if one can build an ICU data object file for ARM anyway (does this enable it?). Ditto for Fuchsia.\n\nThanks for looking at this.\n",

      "message": "As you can see I have done so. While it might be putting it strongly that the change is \"needed\", it\u0027s certainly important to me for Windows builds and, in general it seems like a nice simplification. Dunno if it facilitates icu_use_data_file\u003dfalse builds on ARM or Fuchsia (no clue whether their C-embedded assemblers are compatible enough with the Linux/Unix assemblers) but it *might* add  icu_use_data_file\u003dfalse capability to those platforms if they don\u0027t already have it so it might be useful beyond Windows. \n\nI\u0027d also argue that it\u0027s pretty low risk as it\u0027s pretty easy to see if it fails and it eliminates some platform-specific code (embedded in Python, no less) which it seems is always a good thing.\n\nThanks for looking at this.",
