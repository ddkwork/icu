In this case, we want to apply the change to all subsequent configs, so I guess patching the file seems easier to maintain.\n\n\u003e I also suggest that a local custom copy of cjdict.txt be put not in icu/filters but icu/\u003csome better name\u003e (dict? maybe).\n\nFurther investigation turned out that it\u0027s paired with `cast/brkitr.patch`, so I moved it into `cast/patch_locale.sh`.",
