      "message": "Hej Frank,\n\nwould you mind to have a look at this CL? A developer encountered a problem when using ICU together with Arm\u0027s Branch Target Identification, see https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-dev/c/7ss8fkLIJOo\n\nInvestigation showed that the necessary flags were missing for gen/third_party/icu/icudtl_dat.S. Hence, I adjusted make_data_assembly.py to amend the correct flags to the generated .S file.\n\nJust to double check though . . . Does the DAT file contain any function definitions?? I couldn\u0027t find any, but if there are, this CL won\u0027t work.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nBest Regards,\nAndre",
