      "message": "Sorry for immediately staring a new CL after https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/deps/icu/+/5004573 got committed, but after testing Node.js GN build on Windows for more targets I realized that my fix was wrong: the leading underscore in symbol names depends on CPU arch instead of compiler on Windows.\n\nI can\u0027t promise this is the final fix as there are still quite a lot of undone job about Node.js GN build, but for now this fixes the Windows build for all arches on both win/linux hosts, a fast review will be appreciated since this is blocking me on making Node.js GN build work on Windows.",

      "message": "The `icu_use_data_file\u003dfalse` arg which used the code in this CL, was introduced purely to make the GN build of Node.js (node-ci) work, there is no other project in Chromium using it as far as I know.\n\nThe node-ci currently only runs for Linux, so I believe merging this CL won\u0027t have any affect to existing Chromium projects. In the meanwhile node-ci needs this change to work on Windows.\n\nI think it is probably hard to find an owner familiar with this part of code, maybe I can find some developers from V8 to review this and then have the owners approve it?",
