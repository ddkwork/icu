      "message": "`-Wenum-constexpr-conversion` has been revised a few times, and I think it does not trigger a warning in `ICU` in the latest version of this warning. The code that originally caused the issue`(UBiDiDirection)-1` has still undefined behavior, right? https://reviews.llvm.org/D131528 mentioned that \"The initial patch effected a lot of users and several third party packages and so I am trying to narrow the impact by restricting the error to those cases that are constant expression contexts only.\". So, my impression is that we might still see this issue in `ICU` when this warning is fully enabled.",
