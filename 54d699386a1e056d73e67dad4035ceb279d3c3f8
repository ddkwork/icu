      "message": "Yes, this is intentional. https://crrev.com/c/2558099 added Icelandic for _only_ Chrome OS, so this should not affect other platforms.\n\nFor:\n\n- Win/Mac/Linux: Icelandic is not available on Chrome Browser.\n- Android: Icelandic has already been included in Android since late 2019 - see https://crrev.com/c/1952288. I assume that Icelandic ICU resources have already been added, but I might be wrong. Maybe Chrome on Android offloads most ICU-related work to the OS? I know https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:ui/base/l10n/l10n_util.cc;l\u003d633-640;drc\u003dd1abcd09edbdf07d7877fbde3ebc282627e0bcd6 is one example.\n- iOS: Icelandic is not available on iOS Chrome.",
