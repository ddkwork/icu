      "message": "I added this during the 73-1 upgrade. ftang@chromium.org noticed there was a high diff in res files because of likelySubtags.txt and langInfo.txt and suggested excluding those files. During the roll to 73-1, I manually modified langInfo and likelySubtags to 72-1 instead of leveraging the update script and this slipped by. It seems like they\u0027re not necessary for chromium ICU but I\u0027m not positive. \n\nhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/deps/icu/+/4475715",

      "message": "The bug was just a tracking bug for the ICU update - no idea why its restricted. Frank probably knows the most. I think the problem was that we\u0027ve increased the binary size of ICU such that it triggered some warnings in the CQ process. If we wanted to push it in, I think we could\u0027ve had an exception. \n\nIt didn\u0027t seem like those files were necessary for Chromium hence why it was ignored.
