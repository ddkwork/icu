      "message": "You don\u0027t need to use this mechanism for brkitr/ja.txt for common. Android, etc need that, though. Well, even for them, we can just temporarily swap files in our build script might be simpler unless a way to use a relative path is found. \n\nJust change brkitr/ja.txt with our copy that uses line.brk instead of line_cj.brk. \n\nThen, add brkitr/ja.txt to scripts/data_files_to_preserve.txt. That\u0027s the way brkitr/{zh,zh_Hant}.txt are handled. These files rarely change so that just preserving them across ICU version is fine.",
