The maintenance won\u0027t be easy. \n\nHow about this ? \n\"-/zoneStrings/*/ec\"\n\nThere\u0027s an issue with empty blocks after dropping ec, but the size impact might not be huge (the size impact of keeping empty blocks is that keys such as \u0027Africa:Abijdjan\u0027 has to be kept, but only once because we use a string pool bundle). See the thread on dropping \u0027ec\u0027 between us and Shane/Markus. \n\nBefore rolling ICU, I think we\u0027d better address this.",
