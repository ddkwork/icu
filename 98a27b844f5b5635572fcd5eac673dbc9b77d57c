      "message": "Hi Jungshik and Frank,\n\nThis one\u0027s kind of bubbled back to the top of issues that would be nice to get resolved (between my day job and a few other V8 CLs had to put this down). I understand your lack of enthusiasm for this change -- if it ain\u0027t broke, don\u0027t fix it. But it seems that it *is* broke, at least for MSVC builds. I can rework this change so the use of a generated C file is only used for MSVC builds which AFAIK simply don\u0027t work with internal ICU data. While that adds complexity rather than reducing it, I suppose, from your perspective, it reduces risk. Maybe if I make it an MSVC-only change and it proves itself, someone might be inspired to simplify and use it for all builds. Or not. Happy just to get the MSVC builds working,\n\nThanks ",
