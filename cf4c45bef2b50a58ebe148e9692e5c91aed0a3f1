      "message": "We actually need this define both for the data file build and the no data file build. The reason is that for the former, we provide an empty data struct in stubdata.cpp; for the latter, we provide the data struct as inline assembly. Both are compiled into object files, so the linker doesn\u0027t see any difference. This define decides on how the data struct is imported in the linker. Missing this define for the icu_use_data_file\u003dtrue case breaks the component build.",
