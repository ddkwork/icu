      "message": "Primarily to make this more hermetic and a bit safer; i.e. ensuring that if someone applies a future mobile-only patch to the flutter target, it doesn\u0027t affect the flutter_desktop target unless they intentionally also apply it to flutter_desktop. \n\nFlutter mobile is *very* size sensitive since the devices in question are often quite storage-constrained (particularly in certain markets). Flutter Desktop ships only on destkop-calibre devices, where adding a few extra MB isn\u0027t an issue, but those devices are much more text-input heavy, so we have a lot of requests for input-related issues like collation, CJK word-break support etc.",
